# Decription of all the functions

set_parameters(), return(X, kern, thresh, max_roi, min_spec_freq, max_spec_freq)  

This function sets a number of parameters needed in other functions. It is called automatically in other functions when needed. Keeping all parameters in one place allows for easier tuning.  

The parameters are:

*X: threshold for binary image (number between 0 and 256)

*kern: kernel size for ROI

*thresh: threshold for SSIM

*max_roi: maximum number of regions within one image (100 ms)

*min_spec_freq: lowest frequency in the spectrogram (1 point =0.375 kHz)

*max_spec_freq: highest frequency in the spectrogram

---

set_freqthresh(num_class), return(min_freq, max_freq)

Sets the frequency of different bats for classification. Every bat has a number called num_class. Needed for the function compare_img.

---

spect(file_name), return(sample_rate, samples, t, total_time, steps, microsteps)

Reads a file and returns the necessary information to make a spectrogram.

---

spect_plot(samples, sample_rate),return(spectro)

Makes a spectrogram and converts it to grayscale values.

---

substraction(spect), return(spectro)

Subtracts the mean from all values in a spectrogram to reduce noise. Called within spect_plot.

---

spect_loop(file_name), return(rectangles2, regions2, spectros)

Extracts the ROIs from a file. This functions calls spect_plot, overload and ROI and ROI2. Spectrograms are created for every 200 ms and split in two. Regions are then extracted using ROI and ROI2.

Rectangles is a dictionary containing coordinates of all regions (stored as colums in the order: x, y of the lower left corner, width, height). Rectangles is labeled as 0,1,2,... (0: between 0 ms and 100 ms).

Regions is a dictionary following the same keys with the extracted regions as subdictionaries (labeled 0,1,2,...)

Spectros contains the full spectrograms (also stored as dictionary with numbered labels).

---

ROI(spect_norm, kern, X), return(ctrs, len_flag)

Extracts ROIs from an image. Spect_norm is the spectrogram, kern and X are called using set_parameters. Returns contours and a len_flag. If len_flag is falsem the image is empty and ROI2 is skipped.

---

ROI2(ctrs, spect_norm), return(Mask, regions)

Converts the contours to coordinates stored in Mask (mask is then assigned to the correct regions key), regions are extracted from the spectrogram (spect_norm). Only used if contours is not empty.

---

overload(rectangles, regions), return(rectangles2, regions2)

Deletes entries from rectangles and regions if there are more than max_roi (to reduce noise). Called within spect_loop.

---

show_region(rectangles, spectros, i), return()

Shows a plot of all the regions as red rectangles on the spectrogram. i is the time key to extract the correct spectrogram from the dictionary.

---

show_mregions(rectangles, spectros), return()

Shows the regions of the entire file one by one. This calls show_region for every i in order. Next spectrogram is shown when pressing enter.

---

compare_img(img1, img2, rectangle, min_freq, max_freq), return(score)

Calculates the SSIM between two images and returns it as a score. If the frequency isn't in the right range, score is set to the minimum (-1). For this, the function set_freqthresh is needed with the correct class number.

---

compare_img_plot(img1,img2), return()

Plots two images so they can be compared by hand. Used to visualise the SSIM.

---

create_smatrix(rectangles, spectros, num_classes), return(s_mat)

Creates an empty score matrix to store the SSIMs for every regio.

---

calc_smatrix(s_mat, regions, rectangles, templates, num), return(s_mat2)

Calculates the score matrix. Must be called again for every class and needs templates and an empty score matrix.

---

create_cmatrix(rectangles, spectros), return(c_mat)

Creates an empty classification matrix to store the label for every regio.

---

calc_cmatrix(c_mat, s_mat), return(c_mat2)

Fills the c matrix. Uses the threshold from set_parameters and the score matrix.

Classes:

*0: empty

*1: non-classified

*n-2: class 0

---

calc_result(c_mat, num_classes), return(res)

Calculates a result matrix counting the instances of every class in c_mat.

---

loop_res(rectangles, spectros, regions, templates), return(res, c_mat, s_mat)

Pools the functions create_smatrix, calc_smatrix, create_cmatrix, calc_cmatrix and calc_result.

---

create_template_set(), return(templates)

Creates a template dictionary from the files 'ppip-1µl1µA044_AAT.wav' and 'eser-1µl1µA030_ACH.wav'

---

show_class(class_num, c_mat, rectangles, regions, spectros), return()

Shows all regions from a class one by one. Press enter for a new plot.

---

loop_full(file_name), return(res)

Uses spect_loop, create_template_set and loop_res to analyse a full sound returning only the result.
