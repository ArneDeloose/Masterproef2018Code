10; Threshold for conversion to binary image. Given as a percentage (default: 10%)
20; minimum frequency in a spectrogram, given in kHz (default: 20 kHz)
120; maximum frequency in a spectrogram, given in kHz (default: 120 kHz)
0.65; threshold for SSIM classification, number between -1 and 1 (default: 0.65)
200; length of the local scaling window in ms (default: 200 ms)
50; overlap between windows in ms (default: 50 ms)
10; Maximum number of regions in a single spectrogram. (default: 10) Remember that the size of a spectrogram changes with spect_window
1; weight of the freq in final score, given as a float (default: 1)
1; weight of the freq range in final score, given as a float (default: 1)
30; weight of the peak freq T in final score, given as a float (default: 30), higher because peak freq T is a number between 0 and 1.
1; weight of the peak freq F in final score, given as a float (default: 1)
5; first dimension SOFM (default: 5)
5; second dimension SOFM (default: 5)
